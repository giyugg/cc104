# HELLO! I'm Kyle Acuña of BSIS 1B-G2
This is my coding journey as I learn Java through our Computer Programming subject at Bulacan State University. I will use this as my journal and archive it after my first year of studying BSIS. I also create my own personal projects here while I learn!<br>

* Git (for commiting projects to store in Github via VSCode.)
* Github (for tracking, storing, and acting as backup of my works.)
* Github Copilot (just to assist with my code. Not actually relying on this, but it's good at predicting.)
* Java Development Kit (latest), Java Runtime Environment
* Live Server (VSC Marketplace, live preview of my HTML projects.)
* Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and Netbeans IDE<br>Note: I use VSC and IntelliJ for personal preference then Netbeans for school requirements.
